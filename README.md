Garbage Job For QB-Core Rework by Idris

Idris' Notes: I've kept the old UI but moved most of the logic to the server rather than client side.

# Rework
- Job now pays per bag delivered on a configured scale.
- Job Randomises the amount of stops and what stops the user goes to
- Job traks rewards on the server rather than client
- Optional Cryptostick find per stop
- Highly Configurable.

# Planned Features
- QB-Target integration
- Custom Routes option instead of completely random. (being worked on)
- Group Mode (was requested but low priority)
